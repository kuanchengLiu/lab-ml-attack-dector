# Advanced Computer Networks HW
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for the detection of
network security attacks. With the increasing prevalence of cyber threats, effective detection
mechanisms are crucial for safeguarding network infrastructure and sensitive data. This project aims
to explore the performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting different types of attacks
and assess their ability to generalize to unseen attack types.

The project highlights the challenges and opportunities in network security attack detection using
machine learning techniques. By systematically evaluating model performance across different
scenarios, valuable insights are gained into the factors influencing detection accuracy and
generalization capability. These findings contribute to the development of more robust and reliable
detection mechanisms for combating cyber threats in real-world environments.
